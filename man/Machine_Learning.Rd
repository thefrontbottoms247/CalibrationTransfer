}
\arguments{
\item{datamatrix}{Numeric matrix or data frame of predictors (rows = samples, columns = features).}

\item{class_vector}{Factor or vector of class labels.}

\item{train_control_method}{Character; resampling strategy ("cv", "repeatedcv", etc.).}

\item{train_method}{Character; caret model identifier (e.g., "svmLinear", "rf", "pls", "glmnet").}

\item{n_runs}{Integer; number of repeated model training iterations.}

\item{grid}{Optional tuning grid for model parameters. If NULL, a default grid is generated.}

\item{folds}{Integer; number of cross-validation folds.}

\item{repeats}{Integer; number of repetitions for repeated cross-validation.}

\item{parallel}{Logical; whether to enable parallel processing.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list of caret model objects and saves performance metrics (\code{metrics}, \code{models}, \code{accuracy.cv}, \code{kappa.cv}) and seeds to the global environment.
}
\description{
Trains and evaluates multiple supervised learning models with support for cross-validation, repeated runs, and parallel processing. Automatically generates default tuning grids for many common algorithms.
