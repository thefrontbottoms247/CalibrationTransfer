\title{CORAL: Correlation Alignment for Domain Adaptation}
\usage{
CORAL(child, parent, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE, lambda = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{child}{Numeric matrix or data frame from the \emph{child} (target) instrument.}

\item{parent}{Numeric matrix or data frame from the \emph{parent} (source) instrument.}

\item{center}{Logical; if TRUE (default), center both datasets before alignment.}

\item{scale}{Logical; if TRUE, scale variables to unit variance before computing covariances.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric; ridge regularization term added to diagonal (default = 1e-6).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the aligned child spectra (matrix) with attribute \code{"A"}
containing the applied transformation matrix. The aligned spectra are also assigned
globally as \code{child}.
}
\description{
Performs unsupervised domain adaptation between a \emph{child} (target) and
\emph{parent} (source) instrument by aligning their covariance structures.
The method "re-colors" the target data so that its covariance matches the
source domain. This helps stabilize calibration transfer when cross-instrument
differences are largely second-order (covariance) distortions.
}
\details{
Given source data \eqn{X_s} and target data \eqn{X_t}, CORAL finds a linear
transform \eqn{A = \Sigma_t^{-1/2} \Sigma_s^{1/2}} such that the transformed
target data \eqn{X_t A} has the same covariance as \eqn{X_s}.

Optionally, both datasets are centered before alignment and the target is
shifted to match the source mean afterward. A small ridge term is added to
each covariance matrix for numerical stability.

CORAL(child.trans, parent.trans)
# child is now globally replaced with its aligned version
PDS(parent.trans, child, child.mod, window = "dynamic", model_type = "PLSR")
