\title{External Parameter Orthogonalization (EPO)}
\usage{
EPO(master, slave, ncomp)
}
\arguments{
\item{master}{A numeric matrix or data frame representing the reference (master) spectra.}

\item{slave}{A numeric matrix or data frame representing the target (slave) spectra.
Must have the same number of samples (rows) as \code{master}.}

\item{ncomp}{Integer. The number of principal components of the difference matrix
to use for correction.}
}
\value{
A corrected slave matrix with orthogonalized signal components removed.
}
\description{
Removes systematic variations between master and slave instruments
by projecting their spectral differences onto a reduced orthogonal subspace.
The method identifies latent components of the difference matrix and subtracts
their contribution from the slave spectra.
}
\details{
This implementation follows the standard EPO approach:
\deqn{X_{corr} = X_{slave} - T_p T_p^\top}
where \eqn{T_p} are the retained principal component scores of the difference matrix.

The global variable \code{slave_cor} is assigned for convenience,
but the corrected spectra are also returned invisibly for use in pipelines.

\examples{
\dontrun{
corrected <- EPO(master_spectra, slave_spectra, ncomp = 5)
}
