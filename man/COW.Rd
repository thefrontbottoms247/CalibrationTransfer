\title{Correlation Optimized Warping (COW)}
\usage{
COW(X, reference = NULL, segment = 20, slack = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame of spectra (rows = samples, columns = variables).}

\item{reference}{Optional numeric vector or matrix specifying the reference spectrum.
If NULL, the mean spectrum of \code{X} is used.}

\item{segment}{Integer. Number of segments to divide each spectrum into.}

\item{slack}{Integer. Maximum number of variables by which each segment can be stretched or compressed.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{Xcow}}{COW-aligned spectra.}
\item{\code{reference}}{Reference spectrum used for alignment.}
\item{\code{warping}}{Warping paths for each sample.}
}
}
\description{
Performs correlation optimized warping (COW) for spectral alignment.
The algorithm divides spectra into segments and warps them within a
specified slack to maximize correlation with a reference spectrum.
}
\details{
This function uses the implementation from the \pkg{prospectr} package.
COW is typically used before building PLS or transfer models to correct
wavelength shifts and improve model transferability.

\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- COW(parent_spectra, segment = 20, slack = 2)
aligned <- result$Xcow
}
