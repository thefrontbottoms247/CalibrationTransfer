\title{Standard Normal Variate (SNV) Correction}
\usage{
SNV(master, slave)
}
\arguments{
\item{master}{A numeric matrix or data frame of spectra from the master instrument
(rows = samples, columns = wavelengths or variables).}

\item{slave}{A numeric matrix or data frame of spectra from the slave instrument,
with the same number of columns as \code{master}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{master_snv}}{SNV-corrected master spectra.}
\item{\code{slave_snv}}{SNV-corrected slave spectra.}
\item{\code{mean_cor}}{Row-wise mean differences between slave and master after SNV.}
\item{\code{scale_cor}}{Row-wise scale ratios between slave and master after SNV.}
}
}
\description{
Performs Standard Normal Variate (SNV) normalization on both master and slave
spectral datasets to remove additive and multiplicative scatter effects.
}
\details{
For each sample (row), SNV standardizes by subtracting its mean and dividing by
its standard deviation:
\deqn{x_{snv} = (x - \bar{x}) / s_x}
This function applies the same operation to both master and slave data and
computes the corresponding mean and scale corrections for later use in calibration transfer.
